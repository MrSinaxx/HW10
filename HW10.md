## 1) 
The linkedin ip from ping.eu and nslookup both came out to be **13.107.42.14**

*Note: If the IP addresses obtained from nslookup and ping.eu are different, it may indicate that LinkedIn is using a content delivery network (CDN) or load balancing, resulting in multiple IP addresses for the same website.*

1. Differences between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP/2:
- Multiplexing: HTTP/2 allows multiple requests to be sent over a single connection, improving efficiency.
- Header compression: HTTP/2 uses header compression techniques to reduce overhead.
- Server push: HTTP/2 supports server push, where the server can proactively send resources to the client without waiting for a request.
- Binary protocol: HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol instead of plain text, which makes parsing and processing more efficient.
- Prioritization: HTTP/2 introduces stream prioritization, allowing more important requests to be processed first.

2. Differences between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:
- Transport protocol: HTTP/2 uses the TCP protocol, while HTTP/3 uses the QUIC protocol, which provides better performance and reliability.
- Multiplexing and parallelism: HTTP/3 improves on HTTP/2's multiplexing and parallelism capabilities, allowing for more efficient and faster data transfer.
- Reduced latency: HTTP/3 reduces latency by minimizing the connection setup time and supporting faster error recovery.
- Improved congestion control: HTTP/3 includes better congestion control mechanisms, allowing for smoother data transfer in congested networks.
- Compatibility: HTTP/2 is widely supported, while HTTP/3 is still being adopted and may not be supported by all servers and clients.

3. The 3xx status codes sent from the server side indicate redirection:
- 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
- 302 Found: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location.
- 303 See Other: The server is redirecting the client to a different URL, which should be accessed using a GET method.
- 307 Temporary Redirect: Similar to 302, but the client should preserve the method used for the original request when redirecting.
- 308 Permanent Redirect: Similar to 301, but the client should preserve the method used for the original request when redirecting.

4. Header usage and application:
- Host: Used in both request and response packets. In the request, it specifies the target host and port, while in the response, it indicates the host that provided the response.
- Referer (Referrer): Used in the request. It specifies the URL of the previous page from which the current request originated.
- Accept-Encoding: Used in the request. It specifies the compression algorithms supported by the client for the response content.
- Content-type: Used in both request and response packets. In the request, it specifies the type of data being sent, and in the response, it indicates the type of data being returned.
- Content-Length: Used in the request or response to indicate the size of the message body in bytes.
- Content-Range: Used in the response to indicate the range of bytes being returned in a partial content response.
- Location: Used in the response to indicate the URL to which the client should redirect.
- Last-Modified: Used in the response. It indicates the date and time when the resource was last modified.
- Cache-Control: Used in both request and response packets. In the request, it specifies caching directives, and in the response, it indicates caching behavior and directives to be followed by intermediaries.

These explanations provide a concise overview of the differences between HTTP versions and the purpose and usage of various headers.
